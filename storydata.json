It\u2019s annoying to watch and listen from the proverbial watchtower, all shit work, no action.",
      "At least you\u2019re getting some homework done as Aegis and Shadow Stalker go about their patrol. It\u2019s annoying because you know exactly why Aegis goes with her. Not because of any attraction, but because he\u2019s one of the few that can keep up with her when she decides that she needs to scare the shit out of some muggers.",
      "And it annoys the <i>hell</i> out of you when she does it to you. Her mobility lets her get ahead of you, and to the action <i>way</i> before you can get there. At least Aegis has the courtesy not to engage unless it\u2019s looking grim for whatever poor sap is getting it.",
      "But whatever. There\u2019s another reason why Aegis wanted you on Console. The whole time thing does come in handy for giving what is essentially a precognitive warning about shit going down.",

Sometimes, I think-\u201d you allow emotion to well up in your voice. \u201cMaybe you\u2019d be better off if you didn\u2019t come to school.\u201d",

Maybe she\u2019ll get popular one way or another, or be a cult hero. She does tend to go overboard. Maybe she'll end up putting someone in a coma. Or maybe she\u2019ll kill someone else who doesn't quite deserve it, and get shipped off. It\u2019s not out of the question.",

It\u2019s irritating that she\u2019ll be capable of going further in that in the coming years. Who knows, maybe she\u2019ll be an actress. Or a professional model. Whichever she is, you think she\u2019ll be taking whatever drugs are popular. She seems to enjoy relying on crutches, using them to feel better about herself. Heroin? Cocaine? Xanax? Hydrocodone? Amphetamines? Plain old alcohol? The tabloids will eat her for lunch.",

The most she\u2019ll ever be is a hanger-on to someone who means something. In the end, her life matters about as much as the people Sophia cuffed yesterday.",
      "\u201cHi Madison,\u201d you say with a smile, adjusting your bag as you keep an eye out for Taylor.",

Green top, denim jacket, grey short shorts, classic Madison discount-Disney-Channel chiq. \u201cHi,\u201d she says, her voice that same chirp you remember. \u201cHow are you doing, Casey? I love your eyeliner.\u201d",

They just aren\u2019t trying hard enough. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t even glare. She just stares at the ground.\u201d",

Taylor almost had a breakdown on phone. I wish I was recording.\u201d You don\u2019t wish you were recording. More evidence against you is bad if it ever goes wrong.",
      "\u201cOh,\u201d Madison says, looking miffed. Probably because she was left out. \u201cWell, um, I had an idea.\u201d",
      "\u201cHm?\u201d You ask, shutting your locker, zipping your bag up, and shouldering it. \u201cDo tell.\u201d",

You wonder for a moment if she just decided not to come to school, but then you see her trudging in, spinning the dial on her locker, going through those motions. \u201cHey,\u201d you say, sidling up to her. \u201cYou okay?\u201d",
      "\u201cYeah,\u201d she says. \u201cThanks for asking.\u201d",
      "\u201cNo problem,\u201d you say, giving her a quick hug. She flinches, then relaxes slightly. You smile, backing off, trying to keep your face suitably injured. \"Sorry. I shouldn't have.\"",
      "She's chewing on her lower lip, and shakes her head before giving you a slight smile. \"My bad,\" she says.",
      "After that little fit of awkwardness on Taylor's part, you bid her goodbye, and head on over to class. You'll be getting out early today for your Wards stuff, so you need to think of what you'll be doing then.",

Look at them, walking the streets together. It\u2019s teeth-grindingly ridiculous. He has no physique, no respect for himself, and plays the fool. Nauseating. His power is disturbing in its randomness, forcing you to rewind at inconvenient moments on occasion. You suspect he has full control over his ability, and does it to antagonize you.",

      "\u201cI mean if you don\u2019t want to do it...\u201d Dennis says.",
      "You head off to do your makeup without another word. You can\u2019t risk hitting Dennis and rewinding. Maybe he\u2019s trying to goad you into hitting him, so he can freeze you and have them take action. So instead, you scrub at your face instead in the bathroom. Your makeup here is easier to apply, but is a more monotonous routine. Your hair tied back, you get to work.",
      "Your fingernail traces a line around your face where the mask will go. It makes the job significantly easier, covering your eyebrows, parts of your cheekbones, and most of your nose. Useful. You apply each level of makeup slowly, methodically. Foundation and concealer go on, then you go to work, slowly matching your eyelids to the mask. You could smear it around, but no. This requires that you take care, it\u2019s just another thing that puts you above people like Dennis, who don\u2019t put in this effort.",
      "A faceless helmet. That\u2019s what makes him bush league. He doesn\u2019t understand that when others see him, what they perceive is a faceless automaton. He may make jokes, trying his best with whatever wits he possesses, but it doesn\u2019t match. There\u2019s no facial expression, no smile. It\u2019s not the face of a hero. No matter how much he might think he is.",
      "You lift your mask, placing it against your face, the mask into place, pressing until it properly adheres itself to the skin. The rest of your time is spent contouring, making your cheekbones and jawline stand out, then\u2014Dennis knocks on the door. Your hand jerks, and you let out a hiss of frustration, rewinding and reblending.",

      "Your lips push together in satisfaction. You don\u2019t do lipstick, not for this. Or at least, you stopped. You\u2019ve been too preoccupied to pick up something in an apparently less lusty tone. And you won\u2019t ask Emma. You can see her, holding it over you, using it to depend on you, a token of reliance.",
      "But it\u2019s necessary to keep paying attention to how the public perceives you. Their image of you and the image you want to present <i>should</i> be identical, but it\u2019s not. Unfortunate and annoying. You\u2019ll have to work to correct that.",
      "You walk out and smile at Dennis, who is now wearing his helmet. \u201cFluke,\u201d he says, giving a little curtsy. \u201cYou look very pretty in a platonic way.\u201d",

Some guy and lady screaming at each other on the street. You can tell Clockblocker just wants to freeze them both and leave it up to the cops. Conflict mediation doesn\u2019t seem to be his forte. The fight quiets down. The woman pukes onto the street.",

      "You keep an eye out, occasionally rewinding as you run toward the supposed mugging. Ah. This is one of <i>those</i> situations. The sort that Sophia would sit on her perch about, waiting for a response. You\u2019re not really into that sort of test. Too much of a pain in the ass to watch them when you could be doing other, more useful things. If someone died on your watch, they\u2019d probably slap you particularly hard for it, too, given your power.",
      "Ugh.",
      "Two gang members. Merchants seems like a reasonable assumption, given their general state of dress, and that one doesn\u2019t seem to take issue with the other being black. \u201cYo, druggies,\u201d you say. \u201cYou take credit or is it cash only?\u201d",

      "The man brandishing the knife at you swipes. You move in\u2014",
      "And it lodges itself in your shoulder. Damn, that hurts. Probably hit something major.",
      "Time crawls back into its hole.",
      "You move in, letting the knife slide by, delivering a stungun to the man\u2019s belly. He convulses, and his hand clenches around the knife. You deliver a knee to the groin, (the knife clatters to the pavement) then zap him again. He crumples.",
      "\u201cStay back, bitch, or I\u2019ll-\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat, you\u2019re going to slit his throat? Upgrade from a aggravated robbery to a murder? You got a gun?\u201d",
      "\u201cYeah, I do,\u201d he says. \u201cSo you better stay back, or I\u2019ll-\u201d",
      "\u201cYou should run and ditch it. Throw it into the ocean or something. You\u2019ve got like five minutes. Possession of a firearm <i>probably</i> won\u2019t look good for you in court if you\u2019ve already done time\u2026\u201d You shrug. \u201cWell, whichever works for you.\u201d",
      "He hesitates. The knife is at the man\u2019s throat. It quivers. Then he breaks and runs. Nice. Didn\u2019t even have to rewind. \u201cConsole, this is Fluke. Situation has been resolved. There\u2019s a guy heading east on\u2026 Wessington..?\u201d",
      "\u201cClose enough,\u201d says Chris. \u201cI\u2019ll call it in. Cops are two minutes.\u201d",

      "He\u2019s not exactly fine, but he\u2019s not bleeding out, so he\u2019s pretty thankful. The usual. Thought he was dead, thought they were going to take everything. He\u2019s ever so thankful, repeat, repeat. Clockblocker shows up a few minutes later. You glance at his shoes. They\u2019re still stained. You smirk, giving him a nod.",

      "In the bathroom, you run your fingers through your hair. You pull it up, letting it fall out of place. Across your eyes, all out of order. Askew. You push it out of your face roughly, and stare at yourself. Not good enough. Nowhere near convincing enough.",
      "You slap your cheek, hard. Little sparks blossom into pain. Your nails run over your arm, leaving thin white lines that swell into redness. You look into the mirror, your eyes downcast, a forlorn frown your only expression. You chuckle.",
      "The door swings open. Sophia walks into the bathroom. \u201cWow,\u201d she says. \u201cYou look like shit.\u201d",
      "\u201cWorking hard at it,\u201d you say, giving her a grin, then looking back into the mirror. \u201cI thought about doing a split lip too, but I don\u2019t want my tongue running over that for the rest of the day. It\u2019d be unpleasant.\u201d",
      "\u201cHm,\u201d Sophia says, her fingers tracing the scratches on your wrist. \u201cI\u2019d just twist her arm, though. No visible damage that way.\u201d",
      "\u201cMaybe you\u2019re sending a message to her through me. Or maybe we got into an argument. Whatever. Doesn\u2019t really matter what she thinks, just that she feels like it\u2019s her fault.\u201d",
      "Sophia lets go of your hand after patting it, giving you a look. \u201cWell, I\u2019m going to go walk into class now.\u201d",

      "You slink into class, clutching your side, your damp backpack held slightly away from you. You find a seat away from Taylor, and put your head in your hands.",
      "\u201cCasey?\u201d says the teacher. Ms. Sloane. She\u2019s never been awful, but never been great, either. \u201cAre you alright? You\u2019re-\u201d she looks at the clock. \u201cTen minutes late.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d you say, your voice trembling. \u201cJust dropped my stuff. Had to clean it up.\u201d",

      "\u201cOh,\u201d Ms. Sloane says, looking for an excuse not to care. She clears her throat, then turns back to the board. She finishes writing out a few more sentences. You do your best to pay attention. When the quiz comes, you\u2019re ready.",
      "You wait for Sophia to finish.",
      "Madison passes by Taylor with her quiz. Taylor, predictably, pulls her bag toward herself, watching Madison come and go.",

      "You get up.",
      "You hand in the quiz with one hand. Your other hand grabs for the phone.",

      "Time grinds back with your teeth.",
      "It takes another three tries before you successfully palm the phone, holding it by your side, your fingernails the major contact point. Or at least as best as you can. You don\u2019t want your fingerprints on it.",
      "Madison raises her hand. \u201cMs. Sloane, can I go to the bathroom?\u201d",
      "She looks over at Madison, then back at the quiz papers, then nods. Madison gets up, walking by Taylor, who eyes Madison once again, her bag going underneath her seat.",
      "Trial and error.",
      "You kneel next to Taylor\u2019s desk, pulling her bag out from under her.",
      "\u201cHey-\u201d she starts.",
      "You ignore her, looking it over. There\u2019s an unclosed zipper, but it would be extremely difficult to get the phone in there. You could try tossing it.",
      "Time flits back.",
      "Three tries later, and you\u2019ve found that the phone has an amazing capacity for bursting open, spilling out into three parts. The back, the battery, and the rest of the phone. The screen only broke one in three of those tries.",
      "Madison elbows Taylor for the fifth time.",
      "Taylor doesn\u2019t even look at her, just at her hands.",
      "You lean to the side, stumbling as you walk. It takes four more before you slip the phone in without any real awareness from anyone. You\u2019re starting to strain yourself a bit.",
      "You sit down in your seat, trying not to let out a massive yawn. Mission accomplished. Wonderful. It\u2019s like you\u2019ve planted a garden. You put the seeds down, and now you\u2019re just waiting for the realization to really sprout.",
      "Taylor keeps to herself.",
      "Madison returns from the bathroom.",
      "Ms. Sloane continues to grade. She stares at a quiz. Then looks harder at it, and reaches for her phone. Her hand pats the table.",
      "There\u2019s that <i>moment</i> of realization that she\u2019s misplaced it. The realization as she goes through her bag, her fingers searching for that familiar shape.",
      "The moment where her search goes from measured and casual to tinged with desperation. It was <i>right there</i>. She didn\u2019t forget it somewhere. It\u2019s not under the desk. It\u2019s not in one of the drawers. She glances behind. It\u2019s not on the little silver shelf protruding from the whiteboard. It\u2019s gone.",
      "Her expression sags. Disappointment and despair. \u201cClass,\u201d she says. \u201cHas anyone seen my phone?\u201d her fingers form a square. \u201cAbout this big, black?\u201d",
      "A murmur sweeps across the class, people shaking their heads.",
      "Taylor is staring straight ahead. Like an animal that\u2019s been kicked too many times, she has a <i>sense </i>for that windup. She doesn\u2019t know why her body is tensing. <i>Something</i> bad is about to happen, so it must be related to her.",
      "Ms. Sloane sighs. \u201cCan anyone take their phone out of their bag to call mine? I won\u2019t confiscate your phones. I promise.\u201d",
      "Taylor doesn\u2019t touch her bag. She doesn\u2019t have a cell phone, so why would she? This has to be about someone else, her mind tells her. Every piece of information her mind can pull up is telling her that this has nothing to do with her. She saw where Madison was. What the other girl was doing. Her bag was safe. Even if Taylor isn\u2019t consciously aware of these facts, they all point to one thing. It can\u2019t be her.",
      "The clamor of people lending Ms. Sloane a phone quiets after she takes one. She begins to input her number. Each button makes a clicking sound.",
      "You hear the call complete, the phone in Ms. Sloane\u2019s hand ringing.",
      "The basic ringtone coming from Taylor\u2019s bag makes you smirk. You cover your mouth, your eyes widening. How <i>absurd</i>. Taylor, a <i>thief</i>?",
      "The realization doesn\u2019t hit Taylor immediately. Like the pain from getting hit, you imagine. It\u2019s the blow that knocks the breath from you, with the blinding white agony after it. Dumb shock. She looks around herself. Then down, at her bag.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s in Taylor\u2019s bag!\u201d says Madison.",
      "You want to kick her desk. What a way to ruin that <i>moment</i> of realization; the moment that Taylor knows that she\u2019s fucked, her faculties shutting down, her heart pounding in her ears as she reaches for her bag, pale face all flushed with embarrassment and shame. Her shame that this could happen to her, and shame that everyone else sees as an admission of guilt.",
      "Taylor\u2019s hand dips down to her bag, and she pulls it up to her desk. She reaches in. Out comes the phone. She\u2019s trembling.",
      "People around you are murmuring, obviously. Various statements. <i>Wow, didn\u2019t think she had it in her. I knew it. Had to be her. </i>Etcetera.",
      "She stands, walking to the front of the class, and places the phone on the desk.",
      "\u201cPlease wait for me outside,\u201d says Ms. Sloane. She takes the phone, puts it in her bag, and begins cleaning up her desk.",
      "Taylor walks to the door, opens it, then closes it behind her.",
      "Was that it?",
      "<i>Really?</i>",
      "You throw your phone at the teacher\u2019s desk.",
      "Time clicks back.",
      "You hear the call complete, the phone in Ms. Sloane\u2019s hand ringing.",
      "You stand, manufactured shock on your face. Your phone clatters from your hand to the floor. Taylor flinches at the sound, looking at you. \u201cNo,\u201d comes your stage-whisper. \u201cThey were right?\u201d",
      "Taylor looks down at her bag. It\u2019s been ringing for a few seconds, but the dawning horror grows on her face. Then it stops. Her face is frozen, her jaw set. Taylor\u2019s hands are trembling, but she looks resigned, picking up the bag, plucking the phone out, and getting up. She begins the walk toward-",
      "Time shivers back.",
      "You hear the call complete, the phone in Ms. Sloane\u2019s hand ringing.",
      "It\u2019s shrill and annoying.",
      "The upbeat ringtone cracks out another response from under Taylor\u2019s desk.",
      "\u201cI knew it,\u201d you say. \u201cSophia was right.\u201d",
      "A murmur sweeps through the class.",
      "\u201cQuiet,\u201d says Ms. Sloane, promptly overriden by your classmates. \u201cTaylor, please bring my phone to me.\u201d",
      "Taylor gets up, carrying the bag. Her too-wide lips set, pressing against each other, making them look thinner than they are. She walks forward.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d you ask, you <i>jeer</i>. \u201cGot caught? Can\u2019t handle it?\u201d",
      "Taylor stops. After a moment, she turns towards you.",
      "\u201cCasey, sit down,\u201d says the faraway voice of Ms. Sloane. \u201cTaylor. My phone.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s a different sort of realization on her face, and you don\u2019t like it. You don\u2019t like the way her face scrunches up, in a manner bereft of any beauty, in a fashion that you know and don\u2019t at the same time. Her mouth opens, closes, then she laughs, once, just an exhalation of disgusted breath. She\u2019s shaking her head, turning away, walking away.",
      "Contempt.",
      "Disgust.",
      "Pity.",
      "At you.",
      "Desks screech. It only takes a few steps. You hit her before you realize it, your fist coming up and striking her in the face. Your hand throbs. \u201cYou don\u2019t <i>fucking</i> laugh at me, you-\u201d",
      "Someone grabs you by the shoulder.",
      "Time creeps back.",
      "Your hand grips the sides of her mouth. She looks at you with wide eyes.",
      "Your heart is pounding. Big thumping beats. You don\u2019t think you\u2019ve ever heard it beat this loud. \u201cYou\u2019re useless. You\u2019ll never be <i>anything</i>. You\u2019re worse off than any of them. You\u2019ll be a fucking greeter at Walmart, scrounging for whatever funding-\u201d",
      "That doesn\u2019t work. The phone rings in the background. She doesn\u2019t understand.",
      "Time creeps back.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve never been my friend. Pretending was so <i>easy</i>. You\u2019re so desperate, wanting someone to talk to, to <i>commiserate with. </i>You\u2019re so <i>stupid</i> to fall for it. How did you manage that?\u201d",
      "There\u2019s an odd sort of acceptance along with the confusion in her eyes. No. That\u2019s not enough. You have to win. She\u2019s pathetic. A rat running a wheel of torment that never stops, and-",
      "Time creeps back.",
      "\u201cYou should have killed yourself. Just take a knife and go at it. I can show you-\u201d No. No, this isn\u2019t working. She doesn\u2019t understand. You aren\u2019t hitting home. She\u2019s just confused, that upbeat ringtone playing in the background\u2014you want her to hurt. You need to find those words that make her crack.",
      "Time creeps back.",
      "\u201cI tried,\u201d you say, as she walks forward. \u201cI tried to trust you. But then this happens. I-I guess they were right.\u201d",
      "When she turns toward you, her eyes are shiny with tears. Her mouth opens. You need more. This isn\u2019t enough.",
      "Time creeps back.",
      "\u201cThey did this to me because I defended you,\u201d you say, gesturing at yourself, at your damp bag. \u201cAnd you start <i>stealing</i>? They told me\u2026\u201d",
      "Taylor isn\u2019t sobbing, but there\u2019s tears welling up, rolling down her cheeks.  She\u2019s shaking her head, clutching her bag to herself. The ringing is muffled.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re just like they said,\u201d you say, voice soft. \u201cYou were just looking for attention.\u201d",
      "Her fingers tighten on the bag. Spindly fingers, nails plain, normal. Boring. Her face is ugly with emotion and panic. A thrill runs through you. You know this. You\u2019ve won, here. You need to hammer it home. Push the point in.",
      "\u201cI really thought we could be friends,\u201d you say, your voice breaking. \u201cI don\u2019t-I\u2014I <i>trusted</i> you, Taylor. I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d do this.\u201d Not good enough. Too trite. \u201cI knew Emma had a good reason\u2014\u201d",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t do <i>anything</i> to Emma!\u201d her voice explodes, the bag now hanging at her side. She\u2019s glaring now. \u201cI come back and she\u2019s decided that she needs to treat me like crap, for <i>what?</i> We were friends! I didn\u2019t do anything!\u201d",
      "Ms. Sloane is up, saying something ineffectual again.",
      "Too close to anger. Almost. You <i>almost</i> had her.",
      "Time creeps back.",
      "\u201c-really thought we could be friends,\u201d you say, your voice breaking. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t-I trusted you. I didn\u2019t believe them. You were just lying to me the whole time, huh?\u201d",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t-\u201d she says, looking at you, her mouth half-open, her hands clinging to the bag for dear life. \u201cI <i>didn\u2019t</i> lie. I swear, I-\u201d",
      "\u201cHow am I supposed to believe you?\u201d you ask. \u201cWith this?\u201d You step forward, grabbing at the bag. Taylor lets go of it, and realizes she has nothing to hang onto. She looks even more uncomfortable, not sure where to put her hands. You reach in, pulling the phone out, pushing it into her hands. \u201cI-\u201d you shake your head, your face scrunching up, gazing at her for a long moment. Disgust. Contempt. Pity. All of those wonderful little emotions play across your face before you let out a short bark of sobbing laughter. You stare at the phone, then back at her face.",
      "It\u2019s picturesque. Gone is any sense of poise, Taylor Hebert is a wreck. She\u2019s trembling once again, her hands clutching the phone to herself in a manner that makes her only look more guilty. Trying to hold onto it. Her nose is running. Tears stream down her face.",
      "You turn and walk away.",
      "<center>--</center>",
      "<center>--</center>",
      "You jerk forward. There\u2019s a headache coming on. The high-pitched whine of the ringing phone in Ms. Sloane\u2019s hand, the answering call from Taylor\u2019s bag. There was something. Something that feels like it\u2019s dripping through your hands, like it\u2019s all a sieve.",
      "Nausea comes as you hear that sound, and you massage your temples. It doesn\u2019t help, but the pressure feels better than the throbbing pain.",
      "You\u2026",
      "You won.",
      "There\u2019s Taylor, staring blankly at the bag now in her lap, which plays that upbeat default tune.",

      "The whispers around you speak of how she\u2019ll probably be expelled. How she\u2019ll get suspended for a month. How they\u2019ve seen people stupid enough to try to steal a teacher\u2019s phone, but this takes the cake. How Taylor Hebert is a failure. Differing opinions that converge upon a single point. She\u2019s in trouble.",

Keeping your eyes closed helps, particularly with your fingers running over some idiot's idea of art scrawled into the upper right corner of the fake-wood.

      "You, on the other hand, rummage through your bag, removing a water bottle and a selection of pills. Gritting your teeth, you rub your temples as you try to figure out a way to take them when nobody\u2019s looking. It\u2019s not like a cocktail of ibuprofen, aspirin, and acetaminophen is like, illegal or anything. But taking pills in front of everyone would look <i>pretty</i> bad. So you have to wait for a little bit until Taylor hands over the stupid phone, the teacher tells her to wait outside, and everyone watches as she leaves.",
      "Then, the pills hit your mouth and you wash them down with water. Maybe fifteen minutes from now you\u2019ll feel better. The bitter and sweet tastes stick around in your mouth. The throbbing headache ebbs, then grows, then ebbs again. The teacher walks out to talk with Taylor. The class starts talking. The talking gets louder. The teacher sticks her head in. The talking gets softer. The door closes, your classmates immediately resumes the loud drone that sticks into your head and swirls around.",

      "As I sat there, the pain ebbed again. Nothing but time did it. Taking the pills was a nice thought.",
      "Second trigger? There were stories of it. It was like my power but on a larger scale, which made sense. Who was that hero? Narwhal? I checked my phone, squinting at the tiny letters. Forcefields that could intersect people. Fantastic. I wondered what her kill count was at.",
      "But that was a reasonable guess.",
      "Taylor had just been acting like the idiot she was. I\u2019d been unable to keep up that little feed of sympathy, so she had flounced off. She was probably crying in the bathroom right now. I\u2019d wondered off and on if she\u2019d stop going to school altogether. Maybe if I \u2018broke up\u2019 with her publically... Maybe I could use this new power to do just that.",
      "It could always get better, after all. I just had to figure out how to do it.",
      "I needed to think on what took place before all\u2026 <i>this</i>. There was the money I gave Taylor, the patrol Sophia and Aegis went on, calling Taylor and Sophia listening in\u2026 Madison\u2019s <i>stupid</i> plan.",
      "There was nothing past Taylor\u2019s break.",
      "After that, it was all\u2014the harder I tried to remember, the more it felt as if I had forgotten some irritating part of what had happened.",
      "I\u2019d rewound, flipflopping that minute back to where she didn\u2019t know anything, just what she\u2019d been accused of. She was going to get suspended?",
      "Yeah. Suspended for a month. Who had told me that? Sophia? Emma?",
      "I punched the bench I was sitting on; the pain from the impact felt a lot better than my head. What was the best thing I could do? I couldn\u2019t recreate the events perfectly. They were splitting from the original way I\u2019d manipulated them already. My abilities were limited by the threat of more pain. There wasn\u2019t anything I cared about saving. It could burn, for all I cared about it.",
      "I\u2019d have to complain about my headache and how terrible it had been. Sophia wouldn\u2019t understand, of course. Her power was to turn into a glorified wraith. She had no insight, no capacity to understand. Maybe I could tell Taylor that I\u2019d stayed up all night, worrying about how Emma was going to pick me apart this time. That I\u2019d skipped because of that.",
      "I wouldn\u2019t need to pretend to be in pain.",
      "But then she\u2019d pity me. That little bitch would think that I was worse than her. Condescending crocodile tears. There weren't a lot of good options. But thank goodness for small concessions, because at least I knew what Madison\u2019s simpering, cute plan was. And my headache was easing up, little by little.",

I\u2019d called her home phone. \u201cIt\u2019s weird. I didn\u2019t do anything. I didn\u2019t fight back. I let them do what they wanted, and they grabbed me, twisted my arm behind my back.

      "The difference in tone was palpable, even though they were the same words. Were they the same words? Yes. I was fairly sure. \u201cWhat should I do?\u201d I asked, <i>pleaded</i>. I wanted to figure out what had caused this change. What had happened? My headache all but forgotten, I was grinning, listening with bated breath.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m\u2014not sure yet,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ll tell you. I promise.\u201d",
      "\u201cOkay,\u201d I said, trying to make my voice sound as small as possible, and not annoyed. \u201cI understand.\u201d",
      "\u201cGoodbye,\u201d she said, voice quiet. \u201cThank you, Casey.\u201d",
      "And then there was nothing but the sound of a phone being put back into its cradle. And my mounting irritation.",
      "<center>--</center>",
      "A new day, which brought with it the benefit of almost no headache. Just a lingering annoyance. And a number of text messages from\u2014Carlos. Interesting. Sophia had been injured. Not too serious, but she wasn\u2019t going to be going on patrol for a while, that was for sure.",
      "Oh well.",
      "She would have taken it as an easy cue to blame me, anyway. Maybe the enforced bedrest would calm her down.",

      "She was going to be pissy no matter what. It was my fond hope that she\u2019d take it out on Taylor instead of trying to do so on me. Actually, it was entirely possible she would. Good. Maybe it was the fact that I'd arrived late, or the fact that Sophia was out of commission, but I didn't see Madison or Emma at their lockers. Probably moping without their favorite athlete to lighten the mood.",
      "Oh <i>man.</i> I hoped that Sophia had been stabbed in the leg. An injury taking her off the track team? She'd be <i>incensed.</i> She'd blame me, of course, but imagining her going after Taylor while on crutches? Heh.",

      "Sophia was the physical one. She was the one who seemed a little too comfortable giving out pain. I\u2019d never really known too much about her, other than the fact that she was the one who was with Emma after I came back. She tripped me, then. Or tried, at least. What a petty, terrible victory to take. What else can I say?",
      "Emma. My old best friend. She knew everything about me. I told her everything. Her eyes were always pretty, and she was nice to me. She listened when there was good and bad. I thought I knew her. I thought we\u2019d be friends forever, pretty much. As dumb as <i>that </i>sounded.",
      "Madison was popular. But she was the sort of hanger-on that Julia was, just... moreso. She was petty. Her pranks weren\u2019t the actions that left me in physical pain, or wanting to cry like Emma\u2019s did, but they were hurtful. Attacking my books, my bag, my clothes.",
      "Was Emma always that way? Was I that stupid, not to notice? Would it have changed if <i>I </i>had changed? If I\u2019d been better somehow? No. That was stupid. But I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about it.",
      "But now I was just running and hiding. More accurately, sitting outside with my lunch, eating it while listening. I\u2019d taken the essentials and left. It was pizza, which made it easy. I chewed at it, not really noticing the taste. Cheese, sauce, crust. I was busier paying attention to the sounds of footsteps, to the voices talking in the hallways behind me.",
      "What <i>could</i> I do?",
      "Was I supposed to ask for Casey\u2019s help? That I\u2019d just\u2014ended up here, not sure what was going on, what was happening, and\u2014",
      "I finished the pizza. Drank my water, then brushed the oily crumbs off my hands.",
      "It was impossible. Even with people who could leap over buildings and catch bullets, it was impossible.",
      "Casey saying words. I still couldn\u2019t remember exactly what she\u2019d said, but I was crying. They had hurt. Her face looked so scared, so betrayed. But it all fell apart then, into whorls and blurs. A dream. It felt like a dream that was coming true, in so many ways.",
      "I wanted to apologize to her. But that wouldn\u2019t make sense now. It felt odd, acting on what I \u2018knew\u2019. Did I know?  The events that played out seemed so eerily similar that I couldn\u2019t help but believe it. But Sophia wasn\u2019t in school today. And Casey had skipped, yesterday.",
      "I took a bite out of the slice of pizza, chewing, then stopped. I held it in my hand, staring at it. It wasn\u2019t easy resisting the urge to drop it, from throwing it away from myself along with the full bottle of water.",
      "A shudder ran through me as I tried to process how much time had\u2014gone back? This time. It had happened the previous morning, too. Some sort of reversal. I\u2019d been walking to school off the bus\u2014and then I was back on the bus. And it wasn\u2019t only me. Everyone else was there, too. Nobody else noticed.",
      "Was that <i>it</i>? The worst precognitive cape in the world. Capable of seeing a few days into the future, once. Seeing tens of seconds into the future at useless junctions. Or maybe I was intermittently traveling back in time for no reason, but only when I didn't care about it. Like one of those terrible jokes about people who had superpowers that did next to nothing.",
      "Nothing else? It didn\u2019t make sense. Or at least, this being a power was more depressing than the alternative. I finished the slice, brushed oily crumbs off my fingers, and started drinking my water.",
      "They planted the phone in my bag, in that dream. And told Casey that I wasn\u2019t to be trusted? That I was a thief? I wasn\u2019t sure there, but as petty and stupid as it all had been, Ms. Sloane was going to suspend me.",
      "I took another bite of pizza, and wanted to scream. What the <i>fuck</i>.",
      "Was I just\u2014hallucinating? I finished the slice as quickly as possible. I picked up the water bottle, opening it and drinking it. And felt like throwing up. Maybe I was a cape, just <i>broken</i>. Like a flickering lightbulb, wouldn\u2019t <i>that</i> be great. The most incompetent cape in the history of capes. Capable of randomly traveling back in time. This was downright comical in the worst possible way. Was I supposed to tell Casey? Or my dad? What was the correct decision? \u201cExcuse me, PRT, but I appear to be suffering from temporal difficulties. How would you best recommend I deal with this?\u201d",
      "They\u2019d think it was a prank call and hang up on me. I had to figure out what was causing it. Was there a method of controlling it? Maybe there was some way to repeat it.",
      "Maybe, maybe, <i>maybe</i>. The word felt like nonsense, I was going around in circles, asking myself questions again, worrying at an element I didn\u2019t have control over.",
      "But at the same time, oddly enough, it gave me something to\u2014focus on? To think about, other than the bullying. I couldn\u2019t just <i>let</i> it keep happening, of course. But at the same time, events were playing out differently.",
      "Was it better to just not take any of my books? To leave my bag at home and hope they didn\u2019t find it? This was stupid. It was <i>all</i> stupid. They\u2019d figure some way to take action against me.",
      "And as much as I wanted to figure this out, it was so tiring. Being constantly aware that they were going to do <i>something</i> made it worse. Not better. I already knew it, of course, but\u2014now I knew what they <i>might</i> do."

      "It was how they saw me in costume, and it needed to be perfect. Foundation and concealer, then the eyelids. I stared at my raccoon face in the mirror and applied the finishing touches, my mask. It was important that they see my face, to see that smile and grin. To watch and speak in ways that Clockblocker couldn\u2019t.",

There had been a domestic dispute, two drunk idiots shouting at the sidewalk, with as much puke as words. I\u2019d left Dennis to deal with it. I could do that again, or I could get him to do that in the first place, pointing out that it didn\u2019t look like much. That I\u2019d seen it already and it wasn\u2019t any big deal. I could even warn him about the puke if he didn\u2019t try to aggravate me.",

      "I gave him a smile and waved back. All I needed to think about when doing so was when I\u2019d walked in on him practicing on his hoverboard. He\u2019d fallen off it and hit the sofa face-first. I had rewatched it at least six times before letting the moment pass. What a waste of space. We didn\u2019t even need him here.",

That rancid mix of alcohol, bile, stomach acid, and whatever else they\u2019d eaten? \u201cYou\u2019re making noises with your tongue.\u201d I imitated it, putting as much disdain into the gesture as I could. <i>Clk-clok</i>. \u201cI\u2019d prefer to keep the channel clear.\u201d",

      "Fuck. No, I wasn\u2019t letting this happen. I had a plan, and I was going to stick to it. I <i>knew</i> where they would be. Maybe the boozehound power couple decided not to get drunk because Shadow Stalker bled all over their apartment steps. Or maybe she\u2019d traumatized them to the point of drinking the first time through, and hadn\u2019t been capable this time. \u201cWhere did Stalker get stabbed?\u201d I asked. \u201cThere\u2019s probably some assholes around there, right?\u201d",

      "He shrugged. \u201cWhy, though?\u201d",
      "If I punched him fast enough, could he still freeze me? I entertained the thought, wishing I was partnered up with anyone else. Sophia. Kid Win. Even Vista would have been better. \u201cI\u2019m going to go check it out. I want to see where they beat the crap out of my teammate. Because she\u2019s my friend.\u201d Without checking if he was following, I began walking.",

      "\u201cYes,\u201d I said, giving him the sincerest smile I could manage. \u201cI kind of want to see if I can give those assholes a good punch for her.\u201d",
      "\u201cAmazing,\u201d he said. I couldn\u2019t tell if he was being sarcastic or not. \u201cThat\u2019s cool of you.\u201d",
      "\u201cConsole to Fluke, Clock,\u201d said Chris. I smiled. Finally. \u201c I\u2019m getting hits on the police scanner. There\u2019s been a report of a mugging. About half a block to your west.\u201d",
      "\u201cDo you want to keep going?\u201d he asked. \u201cI can mop that up.\u201d",
      "I ground my teeth before making sure I still had a pleasant expression pasted on. \u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cI can do it. You go scout. I\u2019ll go deal with the mugging.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s not fair to you-\u201d",
      "There was a scream from the\u2014the apartments. Not in the direction of the mugging. Had it happened, just later? \u201cGo check that out,\u201d I said, pushing as much urgency into my voice as I could manage. \u201cI\u2019ll go grab the mugging.\u201d",
      "I could almost hear him frown with disappointment. He didn\u2019t want to go. \u201cYou sure?\u201d",

      "\u201cThe fuck you on about,\u201d said mugger no.1, looking back at his teammate, knife still held out toward me.",
      "I took my chance then, jumping forward, one hand dipping to my belt. Out came the mugger no. 2\u2019s pistol, but I was close enough to use the first mugger as a shield. Or a hostage, at least. My hand wrapped around his knife hand as I delivered my stungun to his stomach. He jerked, limbs twitching. But then he was falling to the floor, giving no.2 a clear line of sight with his pistol.",
      "\u201cCome on,\u201d I said, goading him. I really felt like hitting him a few more times. Get some of this frustration out on him. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a long life of meth ahead of you. No need to put those years in rehab to waste by shooting me. Just toss the gun over there, run, and I\u2019ll conveniently forget your face.\u201d",
      "His hands shook.",
      "I stepped forward.",

      "\u201c-on,\u201d I said. I wasn\u2019t taking <i>that </i>chance. \u201cDrop the gun. You can get out of this with your ass intact. No need for murder.\u201d",
      "He glanced at his buddy, then at me, then dropped the gun and ran.",

      "He squirmed away from it. Piggot would probably give me a useless talk. Whatever. Not like I\u2019d done anything too awful. Wish I\u2019d hit that guy, though. I settled for cuffing the other mugger.",

      "I gritted my teeth, trying to think of what to say. Emma was suspicious, but that suspicion was fragile. She didn\u2019t know the full story, if I knew Sophia. Sophia would have raged, angry and ranting. Blaming everyone else, looking to lash out. How to best use that to my advantage?",
      "\u201cBecause I-\u201d I said, paused, then lowered my voice, letting it choke up a little. \u201cI was afraid.\u201d",
      "\u201cAfraid of <i>what</i>?\u201d Emma said. I listened for her response. How receptive was she? \u201cThat Sophia would beat the crap out of you?\u201d",
      "Afraid of laughing at her on crutches, maybe. \u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cI just wasn\u2019t myself this morning, and you <i>deserve</i> an apology. I was still in serious pain from some sort of reaction. From my powers. I don\u2019t have any idea when it happened.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo you just\u2014passed by on your stuff yesterday because of that?\u201d Doubt. That was doubt, which was wonderful. It meant she was thinking it over, now unsure.",
      "\u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I would have even been able to\u2014to use my powers to warn her. I felt like <i>crap</i>, Emma. I-yeah. It wasn\u2019t the <i>best </i>option<i>, </i>but I just couldn\u2019t do it.\u201d",

You <i>know</i> Sophia, Em.\u201d It was easy to run circles around Emma. After all, I was a hero. I was a Ward. I wasn\u2019t on probation. And Emma? She was scared of Sophia. That little lingering fear, that if Sophia was prodded too hard, she\u2019d react. She\u2019d <i>seen</i> Sophia at her most violent. Even if Sophia couldn\u2019t do anything to me, a prod to Emma\u2019s self-preservation? \u201cI don\u2019t want her to hurt me, or anyone else. If she can\u2019t do track for a few weeks\u2026 Or patrol?\u201d",
      "Emma didn\u2019t say anything. I wanted to see her face, to see her indecision, to watch her chew those perfectly painted lips raw.",
      "\u201cEmma? Please,\u201d I said, plaintive. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean for her to get hurt. And I was just\u2014hoping you could talk with her. Smooth things over? A bit?\u201d",
      "There was an intake of breath. Then a sigh. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll see what I can do. I don\u2019t know how much she\u2019ll listen to me, but I\u2019ll try. You better say sorry to her too, okay?\u201d",
      "I rolled my eyes, my jaw clenched. Right. The entire thing wasn\u2019t even my fault. \u201cYeah,\u201d I said. \u201cI will.\u201d",
      "\u201cGood.\u201d She hung up, and I shrugged, heading to the bus stop. I hadn\u2019t even needed to rewind. At least <i>that</i> had gone flawlessly.",

      "Was that what she\u2019d said? I tilted my head. That was wrong. Something was wrong. \u201cThat\u2019s a shame,\u201d I said. I\u2019d said that, right?",
      "\u201cYeah,\u201d she said, as if confirming it.",
      "I started up the steps. Suddenly, I was the one struggling not to suck for air like Sophia. I tried to control my breath, but something wasn\u2019t right.",
      "\u201cWeren\u2019t you-\u201d Taylor said, then paused. I turned, looking at her. My hands were clenched at my sides, my teeth clenched together. This was wrong. She shouldn\u2019t have stumbled. She hadn\u2019t stumbled before. My heart pounded. My skin itched. I glanced at the entrance to Winslow, then back to Taylor.",
      "\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked, my voice a husky croak. I coughed, then tried again. \u201cWhat?\u201d Better. Not better. It was all worse.",
      "\u201cNevermind,\u201d Taylor said. My ears strained, listening for any suspicion. Any realization. \u201cJust-yeah. Nevermind.\u201d She kept going up the steps, and I let out a quiet sigh of relief. But I couldn\u2019t let it go. I had to know. This wasn\u2019t possible, but it was happening.",
      "But maybe I\u2019d fucked up. Maybe I\u2019d acted differently, causing her to react in a manner that surprised her.",
      "Time jittered back.",
      "\u201cHey,\u201d I said, hopping off the stairs. Falling in alongside her.",
      "Taylor stumbled, but caught herself faster this time, watching her feet. Consternation graced her face, mixed with frustration. She seemed unaware of me in that moment, glaring at the steps before looking back up.",
      "\u201cYou alright?\u201d I asked.",
      "\u201cYeah,\u201d she said, false cheer and anger seeping in, sounding as if she was trying to convince herself more than me.  \u201cI\u2019m just <i>fine</i>. It\u2019s all okay. I\u2019m good.\u201d",
      "\u201cCool,\u201d I said. \u201cCool.\u201d  Suddenly, I was unsure what to do next. Taylor had some sort of power. But I didn\u2019t know anything about it. And I couldn\u2019t rewind to test for it. How fast could she figure it out? Could I do anything to stop her? Was it resistance to powers? A method of ignoring them? But she was unaware <i>who</i> was causing it. So far. Fuck. How restricted was I? How little could I accomplish? I couldn\u2019t act and re-act while she was around.",
      "Going our separate ways was almost a physical pleasure, now that I knew. I had to tell Sophia. Or Emma. Anyone that could help. Well, that list seemed slim. It wasn't as if I could walk up to Armsmaster and tell him about my problems.",

      "I shivered. Did she know now? Had something I\u2019d done tipped her off? No. There was nothing. She spun the dial on her locker. 48, 22, 65.  \u201cHey, Taylor,\u201d I said. My voice was normal, wasn\u2019t it? It didn\u2019t sound odd. \u201cHow are you?\u201d",
      "Taylor stared at the interior of her locker for a moment. What the hell was she looking for? \u201cFine,\u201d she said, after what must have been ten seconds, finally turning to look at me. \u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d I said. Space cadet city over there. Her eyes never lingered on mine, instead glancing back and forth, on one object one moment, on another the next. I snapped my fingers. \u201cHey,\u201d I said, a bit more harshly and annoyed than I had originally intended, and forced my tone into kind concern. \u201cYou <i>really</i> okay? Anything wrong at home?\u201d",
      "\u201cNo!\u201d she said, blinking and meeting my eyes. It didn\u2019t last. Back staring at a particularly interesting tile. Maybe the puke-green and shit-brown appealed to her. \u201cI\u2019m fine. I promise. Just\u2014didn\u2019t sleep well.\u201d",
      "\u201cOkay. Well, if anything goes wrong, or you want to talk, I\u2019m here, okay?\u201d",
      "\u201cYeah,\u201d Taylor said. She wandered off, presumably to her first class. \u201cThank you.\u201d",
